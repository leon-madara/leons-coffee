## About the Project
**Leon’s Coffee** is a full-stack portfolio site that blends my expertise in web development and UI/UX design. It’s a live, interactive showcase of my skills, featuring:
- A modern, responsive layout
- Realistic coffee shop branding
- Animated, interactive sections
- A seamless user experience from design to deployment

## Design & UI/UX Journey
### 1. Research & Branding
- Analyzed **20+** coffee shop sites for trends and usability.
- Developed Leon’s Coffee’s unique color palette:
  - ![#005F73](https://placehold.co/15x15/005F73/005F) `#005F73`
  - ![#D98D50](https://placehold.co/15x15/D98D50/D98D) `#D98D50`
  - ![#DFCBAA](https://placehold.co/15x15/DFCBAA/DFCBAA) `#DFCBAA`
- Designed a geometric pattern language and selected modern, readable fonts.

### 2. Wireframes & Prototypes
- Created **low-fidelity wireframes** to map user flows and layouts.
  
- Built **high-fidelity prototypes** in Figma with interactive elements and micro-animations.

### 3. UI Components & Iteration
- Designed **reusable Figma components** for cards, menus, and galleries.
- Iterated based on feedback and user testing, refining **accessibility and responsiveness**.
